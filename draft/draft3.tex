\section{Introduction}

The discovery of cosmic acceleration \citep{Riess1998,Perl1999} implies the existence of a ``dark energy'' component in the Universe 
or the breakdown of Einstein's gravity theory on cosmological scales.
The theoretical explanation and observational probe of cosmic acceleration has attracted 
tremendous effort in the last two decades and are still far from well understood or accurately measured \citep{SW1989,Li2011,DHW2013}.
%, but its properties still remain far from accurately known and its nature still remains mystery. 
%The simplest and currently favored solution is the additional field called dark energy which has negative pressure and is spatially homogeneous.
%The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant or vacuum energy, with constant equation of state (EoS) $w = -1$.


In an effort to probe the cosmic expansion history the large scale structure (LSS) surveys enable measurements of two geometrical quantities, 
the angular diameter distance $D_A$ and the Hubble factor, $H$. 
If they were precisely measured as a function of redshift, 
tight constraints can be placed on cosmological parameters, 
e.g. the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy $w$.

%As one geometrical effect of cosmological parameters on LSS,  
When an incorrect cosmological model is assumed for the coordinate transformation from redshift space to comoving space,
geometric distortions are produced in the constructed galaxy distribution. 
These distortions include the ``volume effect'' which is the mis-scaling of the size of structures,
and the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect, the shape distortion induced by the fact that distances along and perpendicular to the line of sight are fundamentally different.
%Measuring the ratio of galaxy clustering in the radial and transverse directions, provides a probe of the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect \citep{AP1979}.
%There have been a series of works studying the application of the AP test to the LSS

Various statistical methods have been proposed to measure these effects.
The AP effect was first suggested to be measured through the anisotropic clustering of galaxies \citep{Ballinger1996,Matsubara1996}. Later, with the advent of large observational spectroscopic programs, this was applied to a series of LSS surveys
\citep{Outram2004,Blake2011,ChuangWang2012,Reid2012,Beutler2013,Linder2013,2014arXiv1407.2257S, Jeong2014,Sutter2014,2014ApJ...781...96L,Alam2016, Beutler2016, Sanchez2016}.
Although there have also been alternative approaches using the symmetry properties of galaxy pairs \citep{Marinoni2010,Jennings2011,BB2012}
and cosmic voids \citep{Ryden1995,LavausWandelt1995,Sutter2014,Qingqing2016}.
Methods proposed to measure the volume effect include the number counting of 
galaxy clusters \citep{PS1974,VL1996}, the topology of LSS \citep{topology},
the BAO scale \citep{EHT1998,BG03,SE03},
and the shape of 2pCF and power spectrum \citep{Sanchez2006,Sanchez2009}.



In \cite{Li2014,Li2015,Li2016} we developed a novel strategy to probe $D_A$ and $H$ from the LSS data.
%proposed a series of methods to probe the geometric information encoded in the LSS data.
We found that the AP or volume effect in general introduces a geometric distortion that evolves significantly with redshift;
this phenomenon can be utilized to distinguish the AP effect from the other effects, such as the redshift-space distortion (RSD).
The radial distances of galaxies are inferred from the measured redshifts, which are distorted by the peculiar motion of galaxies, 
leading to apparent distortion in the redshift space galaxy distribution \citep{FOG,Kaiser1987,Ballinger1996}.
It is the major systematic effects limiting our ability to probe the geometry of LSS from the galaxy distribution.
However, we found that the influence of RSD is significantly reduced when we consider only the redshift dependence of the distortion.

\cite{Li2014} attempted to use the {\it galaxy density gradient field} 
to characterize the redshift evolution of the LSS distortion. 
We tested the idea on the Horizon Run 3 (HR3) N-body simulations \citep{horizonrun},
showing that the redshift evolution of the gradient field 
can be used to infer unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters and that it is, largely, insensitive to RSD.
The same topic was revisited in \cite{Li2015}, 
using a slightly modified version of the usual anisotropic galaxy two-point correlation function (2pCF), $\xi(\mu)$, 
where $\mu\equiv \cos \theta$ and $\theta$ is the angle between the connection of the galaxy pairs and the line of sight direction.
When an incorrect cosmological model is adopted, 
the shape of $\xi(\mu)$ is altered due to the anisotropic distortion of the LSS (the AP effect), 
and the amplitude is shifted due to the change in the comoving volume elements;
both effects have significant redshift dependence.
Although the RSD effect significantly distorts $\xi(\mu)$, 
it exhibits much less redshift evolution.
The method was applied to BOSS DR12 galaxies \citep{Li2016} to probe the redshift dependence of the AP effect, 
and we arrive at tight cosmological constraints competitive with mainstream probes of SNIa, BAO, CMB.

In this paper we continue our exploration of this strategy and present 
a new method using the redshift evolution of the shape of the {\it galaxy angular 2pCF} as a function of radial scale, $\omega(r_{\bot})$,
to constrain cosmology.
A wrongly adopted cosmology result in {\it redshift-dependent mis-scaling} of the galaxy distribution,
which leads to redshift-evolution of the shape of $\omega(r_{\bot})$.
The signal is sensitive to the cosmological parameters and relatively insensitive to the other effects such as the gravitational growth of structure,
the galaxy bias, and the RSD effect.
We apply our method to HR4 mock galaxies, using hundreds of millions of galaxies at redshifts $0\leq z\leq2$
and develop the statistical procedure to constrain cosmological parameters.
 

%In this paper we continue our series of work and probe to use the angular correlation function as a statistical tool to probing the volume effect in the angular direction.
%The method of redshift dependent AP effect has been shown great power to constrain cosmological parameters \cite{Li2014,Li2015,Li2015}.
%We hope this method also.
%The two methods probe different information encoded in the 2pCF and can be combined to fully probe the geometrical effect in LSS.
%Or one can also use the redshift evolution of 2D 2pCF xi(s,mu) to have all information included.
%We developed a method measuring the redshift of the shape of galaxy angular correlation function, $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$, to constrain cosmology.
%A wrongly adopted cosmology result in redshift-dependent mis-scaling in the constructed galaxy distribution,
%which shifts apparent scale of the clustering patterns;
%this manifests itself as a redshift-dependent rescaling of the measured angular correlation function.
%We find this signal is sensitive to the adopted cosmological parameters and relatively insensitive to the gravitational growth of structure,
%the galaxy bias, and the RSD effect.
%We test our method on the HR4 mock galaxies.
%The method can be applied to current and future LSS surveys,
%especially, the photometric surveys such as DES and LSST which probe a large amount of galaxies and the large redshift error will not quite affect the angular 2pCF measurement.

The outline of this paper proceeds as follows. 
In \S 2 we briefly review the nature and consequences of the LSS geometric distortion when performing coordinate transforms in a cosmological context. 
In \S 3 we describe the N-body mock galaxies used to test our method.
The methodology is presented in \S 4.
The cosmological constraints from the method is presented in \S 5.
We conclude in \S 6.

%Considering we are Let us consider an object in the universe with certain size and shape.
%Its observed redshift span $\Delta z$ and angular size $\Delta \theta$ are related with the comoving sizes by
In this section we briefly introduce the scaling effect caused by incorrectly assumed cosmological parameters.
A more detailed description has been provided in \cite{Li2014,Li2015,Li2016}.

Suppose that we are probing the size of some objects in the Universe.
We measure their redshift span $\Delta z$ and angular size $\Delta \theta$,
then compute their sizes in the radial and transverse directions using the following formulas
\begin{equation}\label{eq:distance}
\Delta r_{\parallel} = \frac{c}{H(z)}\Delta z,\ \ \Delta r_{\perp}=(1+z)D_A(z)\Delta \theta,
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $D_A$ is the angular diameter distance.
In the particular case of a flat universe composed of a cold dark matter component and a constant EoS dark energy, they take the forms
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:HDA}
& &H(z) = H_0\sqrt{\Omega_ma^{-3}+(1-\Omega_m)a^{-3(1+w)}},\nonumber\\
& &D_A(z) = \frac{1}{1+z}r(z)=\frac{1}{1+z}\int_0^z \frac{dz^\prime}{H(z^\prime)},
\end{eqnarray}
where $a=1/(1+z)$ is the cosmic scale factor,
$H_0$ is the present value of Hubble parameter and $r(z)$ is the comoving distance.

When incorrect values of $\Omega_m$ and $w$ are adopted, 
the inferred $\Delta r_{\parallel}$ and $\Delta r_{\perp}$ are also wrong,
resulting in wrong estimations of the object's shape (AP effect) and size (volume effect).
These effects and their cosmological consequences have been studied in \cite{Li2014,Li2015,Li2016}.

In this paper we focus on the mis-estimation of the angular size $\Delta r_{\perp}$. %scaling of angular size,
The ratio of mis-estimation is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:DA}
 %{\rm Degree\ of\ volume\ magnification \equiv}
 %{\rm rat}_{\rm volume\ mag}\equiv
 \alpha_{\perp} \equiv \frac{\Delta r_{\perp, \rm wrong}}{\Delta r_{\perp, \rm true}}
 = \frac{D_{A, \rm wrong}}{D_{A, \rm true}},
\end{equation}
where ``true'' and ``wrong'' denote the values in the true cosmology and wrongly assumed cosmologies respectively.

An illustration is provided in the left panels of Figure \ref{fig_xyquan}.
Suppose that the true cosmology is a flat $\Lambda$CDM with present matter ratio $\Omega_m=0.26$
and standard dark energy EoS $w=-1$.
If we were to distribute a series of perfect squares at distances ranging from 500 Mpc/h to 3\,000 Mpc/h,
and an observer located at the origin were to measure their redshifts and infer the sizes of the squares
using the distance-redshift relations of four incorrect cosmologies
\begin{eqnarray}
 & &{\rm (i)}.\ \Omega_m=0.40,\ w=-1.0, \nonumber \\ 
 & &{\rm (ii)}.\ \Omega_m=0.15,\ w=-1.0, \nonumber\\ \noindent
 & &{\rm (iii)}.\ \Omega_m=0.26,\ w=-0.5,\nonumber\\ \noindent
 & &{\rm (iv)}.\ \Omega_m=0.26,\ w=-1.5,  \nonumber \noindent 
\end{eqnarray}
then the shapes of the squares appear distorted (AP effect),
and their sizes are wrongly estimated (volume effect).
Cosmological models (i,iii) result in compressed volume elements (in both angular and LOS direction),
and the degree of compression increases with increasing distance;
the situation is opposite for the other two cosmologies.

The mis-estimation of angular size, ${\Delta r_{\perp, \rm wrong}}/{\Delta r_{\perp, \rm true}}$, 
is displayed in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig_xyquan}.
In all cosmologies, ${\Delta r_{\perp, \rm wrong}}/{\Delta r_{\perp, \rm true}}$ evolves significantly in the redshift range $0\leq z\leq 2$.
As an example, when adopting the quintessence cosmology $\Omega_m=0.26,\ w=-0.5$,
the angular size is underestimated by 
%12.5\%, 17.7\%, 20.1\%, 21.3\%
8.9\%, 12.3\%, 13.6\%, 14.1\% 
at $z=0.5,1,1.5,2$.

%Thus, when wrong cosmological parameters are adopted,
%the apparent size of objects are distorted, and the magnitude of distortion also varies with redshift.

In sum, as a consequence of incorrect cosmologies 
the size of objects is mis-estimated and the magnitude of mis-estimation depends on the redshift.
We use the galaxy angular 2pCF to probe the mis-estimation of angular size, ${\Delta r_{\perp, \rm wrong}}/{\Delta r_{\perp, \rm true}}$.


\section{The Simulation Data}\label{sec:data}

We test the method using the mock galaxy samples produced by the Horizon Run 4  (HR4) N-body simulation \citep{hr4,hong2016}.

HR4 was made within a cube of volume $({3.15}\ h^{-1}\rm Gpc)^3$ using  $6300^3$ particles with mass $m_p\simeq 9 \times 10^9 \hMsun$.
The simulation adopted the second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) initial conditions at $z_{i}=100$
and a WMAP5 cosmology $(\Omega_{b},\Omega_{m},\Omega_\Lambda,h,\sigma_8,n_s)$  = (0.044, 0.26, 0.74, 0.72, 0.79, 0.96) \citep{komatsu 2011}.
%The particle mass is $\simeq m_{p} \simeq 9.02 \times 10^9 \hMsun$.
%This starting redshift, combined  with 2LPT initial conditions, ensures an accurate mass function and power spectrum \citep{2014NewA...30...79L}. 

Mock galaxies are produced from the simulation based on a modified one-to-one correspondence scheme \citep{hong2016}. 
The most bound member particles (MBPs) of simulated halos are adopted as tracers of galaxies.
The merger timescale is computed to obtain the lifetime of merged halos.
Merger trees of halos are constructed by tracking their MBPs from $z = 12$ to 0;
when a merger event occurs, the merger timescale is computed using the formula of \cite{jiang2008} to 
determine when the satellite galaxy is completely disrupted.
%We modeled the position and the velocity of a galaxy from the position and velocity of its corresponding MBP.
%By using the abundance matching, 
%we modeled the luminosity of a central/isolated galaxies from their current mass
%and of satellite galaxies from their mass at the time of infall.

The resulting mock galaxies were found to reproduce the 2pCF of the SDSS DR7 volume-limited galaxy sample \citep{zehavi2011} very well.
The mock galaxies shows a similar finger of god (FOG) feature \citep{FOG} as the observation.
The projected 2pCF of the mock and observational samples agree within 1$\sigma$ CL
on scales greater than 1 ${h^{-1}}$Mpc.

%As will be introduced in the next section, 
%The output of HR4 simulation includes one all-sky light cone mock galaxy catalogue reaching $r=3\,150$ ${h^{-1}}$Mpc 
%and a series ({\bf how many?}) of snapshot mock galaxy catalogues at different redshifts.
We take the snapshot data of the mock galaxies at $z=0,0.5,1,1.5,2$.
%We require subhalos to have at least 30 member particles, 
%so the minimal mass of galaxies is $\simeq m_{p} \simeq 2.7 \times 10^{11} \hMsun$.
Setting a minimal halo mass of $3\times 10^{11} \hMsun$, 
%$4.57\times 10^8$, $4.06\times 10^8$, $3.52\times 10^8$, $3.06\times 10^8$ and $2.28 \times 10^8$ mock galaxies,
we select 457, 406, 352, 306 and 228 million mock galaxies at the five redshifts,
corresponding to a number density of 
%$1.46\times 10^{-2}$, $1.30\times 10^{-2}$, $1.13\times 10^{-2}$, $0.98\times 10^{-2}$ and $0.73\times 10^{-2}\ (h^{-1} \rm Mpc)^{-3}$,
1.46, 1.30, 1.13, 0.98 and 0.73 in units of $ 10^{-2} h^{3} \rm Mpc^{-3}$
%$1.46\times 10^{-2}$, $1.30\times 10^{-2}$, $1.13\times 10^{-2}$, $0.98\times 10^{-2}$ and $0.73\times 10^{-2}\ (h^{-1} \rm Mpc)^{-3}$,
respectively.
Applying a uniform mass cut, at higher redshift we obtained a smaller number of galaxies with {\it larger bias}.

As an illustration, Figure \ref{fig_scatter} displays the 2D distribution of a subsample of mock galaxies in five redshifts,
with $x$, $y$ coordinates computed using the ``correct'' cosmological parameters $\Omega_m=0.26,\ w=-1$ (left panels) 
and a set of wrong cosmological parameters $\Omega_m=0.05,\ w=-1.5$ (right panels), respectively.

When the correct cosmology is adopted the cosmic scale is correctly estimated,
the main factor leads to redshift evolution of galaxy distribution is the gravitational growth of structure.
With decreasing redshift, we clearly see the clusters and filaments form and grow.
On the other hand, when the wrong cosmology is adopted, there is an artificial scaling of distances in the constructed map.
The separations among galaxies are over-estimated by 
$25.6\%,47.3\%,62.2\%,71.7\%$ at redshifts of $0.5,1.0,1.5,2.5$,
leading to a clear redshift evolution of sizes of structures.

The growth of structure increases the clustering and results in more compact structures,
while the volume effect maintains the clustering pattern and uniformly re-scales structures on all scales.
The imprint of each of these effects on the large scale structure is different and should be distinguishable.
In the following section we show that they affect the angular correlation function measurements in different ways, 
and thus can be easily separated.

%The growth of structure also make the size of structures evolves with redshift.
%In the next subsection we will discuss how to distinguish these two effects in the galaxy angular 2pCF.

%taken from the five snapshots.
%The gravitational growth of structures with decreasing redshift is clearly shown.
%We display all mock galaxies with $M> 3.0 \times 10^{11} \hMsun$.

\section{Methodology}

%\subsection{Galaxy distribution at different redshifts}

We use the angular 2pCF as a statistical tool to probe the volume effect.
The galaxy 2pCF as a function of galaxy separation in the angular direction, $\omega(r_\perp)$, is computed for snapshot data of mock galaxies at redshifts 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2.
We adopt the Landy-Szalay estimator~\citep{1993ApJ...412...64L},
\begin{equation}
\omega(r_\perp)=\frac{DD-2DR+RR}{RR}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $DD$ is the number of galaxy--galaxy pairs, 
$DR$ the number of galaxy-random pairs, 
and $RR$ is the number of random--random pairs, 
all separated by a distance defined by $r_\perp\pm\Delta_{r_\perp}$ where we choose $\Delta_{r_\perp}=1h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.
The random catalogue consists of unclustered points uniformly distributed in the same space as the simulated data.. 
In an effort to reduce the statistical variance of the estimator, we use 50 times as many random points as we have galaxies.

Considering the large number of galaxies and random points the 2pCF is computed part by part in subsamples with 
size of 1575 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}\times 1575\ h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}\times 105\ h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$.
The `sheet'-like shape of the subsample is similar to the shape of redshift shells in the real observational case.
The Z direction with thickness $105\ h^{-1}\rm Mpc$ is treated as the radial direction (the $r$ direction) 
and the X-Y directions %with each of width $1575 h^{-1}\ \rm Mpc$ 
are the angular plane.
For our simulation box size we have 120 such subsamples.
The average of the measurements in all subsamples is taken as the 2pCF of the whole sample,
while the covariances of them are taken to be the covariance matrix (after multiplying by a factor of $1/\sqrt{119}$).


\subsection{Galaxy angular 2pCF: at different redshifts}\label{sec_2pCF_diffz}

  Upper panels show that in the correct cosmology the redshift evolution of the shape of 2pCF is rather small regardless of the large redshfit evolution of the amplitude, 
  whereas the lower panels show that, in a wrong cosmology $\Omega_m = 0.05,w=-1.5$, the redshift evolution of $\hat{\omega}_{r_\perp}$ is very significant.
   }
\end{figure*}

The upper-left panel of Figure \ref{fig_diffz} displays the angular 2pCF measured from HR4 mock galaxies. % (multiplied by scale $r$) in the five snapshot.
We multiply $\omega$ by the separation $r_\perp$ to have similar size of statistical uncertainty on all scales.
For convenience we will use the denotation
\begin{equation}
 \hat \omega_{r_{\perp}} \equiv r_{\perp} \omega.
\end{equation}


Among the different redshift bins there is large variation in the amplitude of $\omega(r_\perp)$.
The amplitude is proportional to the clustering strength, which is affected by the gravitational growth of structures and the galaxy bias.
The amplitude is highest at $z=0$ where the structures experienced the most growth.
$\omega(r_\perp)$ increases at $z>1$ with increasing redshift 
as a reason of increasing galaxy bias.
%leading to stronger clustering strength and higher amplitude of 2pCF.
%On the contrary, at higher redshift we find $\omega(z=2)>\omega(z=1.5)>\omega(z=1)$,
%The trend is different from $z=1,1.5,2$,
%simply because by applying a uniform mass cut we are selecting more biased galaxies at higher redshift.

Although there is large variation in amplitude between the different redshifts bins, 
%The shape of $r_\perp\omega$ also evolves with redshift.
the shape of $\omega_{r_{\perp}}$  remains similar at all redshifts;
in general it peaks at $r\sim9 h^{-1}\rm Mpc$ and monotonically drops or increases at larger or smaller scales.
The only exception is the small enhancement at $r\lesssim 2 h^{-1}\rm Mpc$,
which is caused by the non-linear growth of structures 
and is much more significant at lower redshift.

In order to directly compare the shape of the 2pCF at different redshifts,
in the middle panel of Figure \ref{fig_diffz} 
we show the $r_\perp\omega$ normalized by the overall amplitude within 
$5h^{-1}{\rm Mpc} < r < 40h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
(here after $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$):
\begin{equation}
 \hat \omega_{ r_\perp} \equiv  \frac{ {r_\perp\omega}(r_{\perp})}{ \int_{r_{\perp, \rm min}}^{r_{\perp, \rm max}}r_{\perp} \omega(r_{\perp}) d r_{\perp} / (r_{\perp,\rm max}-r_{\perp,\rm min}) },
\end{equation}
where we choose $r_{\perp, \rm min}=5 h^{-1}$ Mpc, $r_{\perp, \rm max}=40 h^{-1}$ Mpc in this analysis.
Below $5 h^{-1}$ Mpc the non-linear growth of structure 
leads to systematic redshift evolution which could be difficult to be reliably accounted;
On scales larger than $40 h^{-1}$ Mpc,
the analytical modeling of the shape of the angular 2pCF is relatively well understood;
one can just fit the 2pCF with the theoretical predictions \citep{BCGS2001,Salvador2014,Salvador2016} 
instead of using our method 
(although our method should also be applicable).

In the upper-middle panel, the overlapping of $\hat\omega_{r_{\perp}}$
clearly show the minimal redshift evolution of the shape.
In the upper-right panel, 
we further show the residual evolution at high redshifts 
with respect to $z=0$.
There is only 1-4\% enhancement 
at $r<10h^{-1}\rm Mpc$,
and $<1.5\%$ suppression at $r>25 h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.
The trend is monotonic with redshift.

There is one detail in the analysis that should be emphasized here.
In real observations we may be selecting {\it different} types of galaxies at different redshifts.
Considering this fact in the comparison of $\hat\omega_{r_\perp}$ 
we compare subsamples of galaxies at {\it different} locations.
As an example, if at $z=0$ we take $\hat\omega_{r_\perp}$ measured within $0h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}<Z<105 h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$,
at higher redshifts we then adopt measurement within $105h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}<Z<210 h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ for a comparison.
%and take the difference between them to get $\delta \hat{r_\perp\omega}$.
%So we are always comparing 2pCF measured from different samples of galaxies.
If we simply compare the 2pCF of the {\it same} subsample of galaxies at different redshifts, 
one would significantly underestimate the statistical uncertainty of $\delta \hat{\omega}_{r_\perp}$ by ignoring cosmic variance.
%The error bars and covariance are always estimated in this way to take the cosmic variance into consideration.
%\footnote{In all figures of this paper The error bars displayed in all figures are estimated in this way; 
%from the 120 subsamples and for the error bar of redshift evolution of 2pCF 
%we always take the cosmic variance into consideration.}.


%As shown by Figure \ref{fig_scatter}, the gravitational growth of strucutre enhance the clustering strengh of structures on all scales;
%here it manifests itself as an enhanced amplitude of 2pCF at low redshift.
%The shape of 2pCF, which represents the {\it relative strength of clustering among different scales},
%maintain similar with redshift except the non-linear scales of $r_\perp < 5 h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.
%mainly increases the amplitude of 

%In all, we conclude that the shape of the 2pCF is more robust than the amplitude against redshift and galaxy bias.

\subsection{Galaxy angular 2pCF: cosmological effect }

The angular 2pCF of galaxy positions constructed in a wrongly assumed cosmology $\Omega_m=0.05,\ w=-1.5$
is displayed in the lower panels of Figure \ref{fig_diffz}.
The mis-scaling uniformly shifts the clustering pattern on all scales, 
leading to a biased $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$, which is 
related with the true $\hat \omega$ as
\begin{equation}
 \hat \omega_{r_\perp,\rm wrong}(r) = \hat \omega_{r_\perp, \rm correct}(\alpha_{\perp} r),
\end{equation}
a simple consequence of the fact that the clustering pattern at scale $r$ is rescaled to $\alpha_{\perp} r$.

The redshift evolution of $\alpha_{\perp}$ leads to redshift evolution of 
$\hat \omega_{r_\perp, \rm correct}$,
%Lower panels of Figure \ref{fig_diffz} shows the $r_\perp\omega$ in five 
%snapshots, in case that the cosmology $\Omega_m=0.05,\ w=-1.5$ 
%is adopted to construct the galaxy distribution (the right panels of Figure \ref{fig_scatter}).
which is displayed in the lower-middle panel.
The upscaling of comoving distance leads to a stretched shape.
When increasing redshift,
the peak location is shifted from $\sim9h^{-1} \rm Mpc$ to $\sim15 h^{-1}\rm Mpc$ at $z=2$,
as a result of the fact that the angular separation is upscaled by $71.7\%$.
Correspondingly, the right panel shows that, 
compared with $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$ at $z=0$ there is a 20-40\% change at higher redshifts.

The mis-scaling not only changes the shape of the 2pCF but also changes the value of the $y$-axis
\footnote{}. %The amplitude of $r_\perp\omega$ is amplified due to the stretch of scale.
As is shown in the left panel, due to the stretch of scale the amplitude is enhanced at higher redshifts;
the higher the redshift, the greater the enhancement.%the amplitude monotonically increases as a function of redshift.

Although the change of amplitude could be a more significant cosmological consequence 
than the alteration of shape,
it is mixed with the other effects; 
the growth of structure and a larger galaxy bias can also lead to a stronger clustering and thus an enhanced amplitude.
%it is more difficult to 
%But this phenomenon can also appear in case of gravitational growth of structure or increasing of bias,
%so we will not make use of it to do cosmological constraint.
In order to reliably extract the cosmological information, 
we just utilize the redshift evolution of the 2pCF shape, 
which is less affected by other factors.
%which is as a signal suggesting that the assumed cosmological parameters are wrong.


\subsection{Systematic effects}

\end{figure*}



In Sec. \ref{sec_2pCF_diffz} we showed that $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$ measured from the
constant mass cut samples at different redshifts show good agreement.
The gravitational growth of structure will not have a large impact on $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$ on scales $\gtrsim5 h^{-1}$ Mpc,
yet there are many other factors that may induce redshift evolution
including galaxy bias, RSD, redshift error, and 
the redshift evolution of galaxies properties 
such as mass, morphology, color, concentration. 
Here we test two ``major'' systematical effects;  the RSD effect and galaxy bias.

%The same as \cite{Li2014,Li2015,Li2016} we need to correct for the redshift evolution of $r_\perp\omega$ caused by effects other than the cosmological effect.

%Figure \ref{fig_diffz} already shows that, the growth of structure, especially in low redshift and on non-linear scales, 
%changes the shape of $r_\perp\omega$ and caused relative enhancement on $r\lesssim2 h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.
%So we limit the region of scale to $r>5h^{-1}\rm Mpc$ to minimize its effect.

\subsubsection{Redshift Space Distortion}

    for four wrong cosmologies.
    The redshift evolution of the angular 2pCF shape in these wrong cosmologies are detected at high CL.
   }
\end{figure*}

The galaxy peculiar velocity contaminates the observed redshift and distorts 
the inferred galaxy radial position.
It is the major systematic in our previous works \citep{Li2014,Li2015,Li2016}
of statistical analysis on the 3D galaxy distribution.

The effect of RSD is much milder in this work. 
The angular positions of galaxies are not shifted by RSD at all;
the only effect of RSD enter in the procedure of 
splitting galaxies into redshift shells.
The galaxies observed in a survey are split into shells of subsamples, 
with different redshift ranges. This allows us to obtain 2pCF measurement at various redshifts.
RSD distorts the galaxy redshift and as a result some galaxies 
(especially those close to the boundaries of shells) are assigned to the wrong redshift shells.

We shift the radial coordinates of galaxies according to the relation 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:zvpeu}
\Delta z = (1+z) \frac{v_{{\rm Z}}}{c},
\end{equation}
where $v_{{\rm Z}}$ (Z is the third coordinate of the galaxy in the box, treated as the radial direction in this analysis) 
is the galaxy peculiar velocity in the LOS direction.
This lead to {\it misclassification} of some galaxies when we split the box into slices.
%Then we split the whole box into 30 slices with thickness $105h^{-1}\rm Mpc$, 
%and measure the angular 2pCF.

The upper panel of Figure \ref{fig_sys} shows how it affects on the 2pCF.
Comparing this plot with Figure \ref{fig_diffz} one can clearly see the effect of RSD.
The amplitude of the measured 2pCF is enhanced by $\sim 10\%$ when considering the RSD effect 
and the slop of $\hat\omega_{r_\perp}$ is suppressed.
However, the redshift evolution of $\hat\omega_{r_\perp}$ remains small,  $\lesssim4\%$ at $0.5\leq z \leq 2$.
Therefore RSD should not significantly affect the application of our method, as long as its redshift evolution is small;
the small effect of RSD can be precisely modelled by simulations and corrected.
%If looking at the redshift evolution,
%the curves $\hat{r_\perp\omega} - \hat{r_\perp\omega}(z=0)$ displayed in the right panel,
%they changed a lot compared with the case of no RSD effect (the right panel of Figure \ref{fig_diffz}),
%but do not become much larger. %But RSD effect does not introduce large redshfit evolution, although the shape of  is 

Similar to RSD, redshift errors of galaxies
also results in fuzzy boundaries of redshift shells
Thankfully, there are some methods for mitigating this effect in photometric surveys using pair-center binning \citep{2010MNRAS.407..520N}. 

\subsubsection{Galaxy Bias}

\end{figure*}

Galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter field;
more massive galaxies reside in regions with higher density contrast
and exhibit stronger clustering (i.e. larger bias).
%In large scale structure surveys, the bias of the galaxy sample is an important fator affecting on the clustering properties of the sample.

We vary the mass cut and check the effect of galaxy bias on $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$.
The second row of Figure \ref{fig_sys} displays the 2pCF measured from galaxies within a $3175\times3175\times105$ $(h^{-1}\rm Mpc)^3$ volume, taken from the $z=0$ snapshot.
Four values of minimal mass limits, $3\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, $1\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$, $4\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and $1\times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$,
are imposed to create samples with different galaxy biases.
The measured angular 2pCF are displayed.

Different mass cuts result in large variation in the amplitude of the 2pCF (left panel);
but the shape of the normalised 2pCF remains less affected (middle panel).
Compared with the sample of $M>3\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$,
samples with mass limits of $1\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$, $4\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and $1\times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$
have amplitude of 2pCFs enhanced by $10\%,\ 50\%$ and $100\%$, 
while the change in the shape is only $0.5\%,\ 2\%$ and $4\%$, respectively.
The effect of galaxy bias becomes much less significant by utilizing the shape of the 2pCF rather than the amplitude.

% {\bf 
The combined effect of galaxy bias and RSD results in larger systematics.
Galaxies that are more biased predominantly reside within nonlinear, over-dense regions and thus have larger larger peculiar velocities.
The third row of Figure \ref{fig_sys} shows that, 
the difference of $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$ among different mass cut samples reaches $1.5\%,\ 4\%$ and $8\%$ in the case when including the RSD effect.

Finally, the fourth row of the Figure displays the 
redshift evolution in case of using samples with constant number density $\bar n=7.3\times 10^{-3} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}h^3$, 
with the RSD effect considered. %(the error bar is a bit larger since for an illustration purpose we only do the computation for 1/30 of the whole sample).
We see the redshfit evolution of $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$ is as small as $\lesssim3\%$.

%In summary, the effect of RSD and galaxy bias on the shape of galaxy angular correlation function is, not large, but it is still non-negligible.
%When dealing with real observational data, one should construct simulation mocks in which these effects are reliably modelled, 
%so that the systematics are corrected and will not lead to significant bias in the derived cosmological constraints.

%In \cite{Li2014,Li2015,Li2016}, the systematic effects contributing to the redshfit evolution of galaxy clusterings 
%are modeled in mock surveys and subtracted.
%Similar treatment could be conducted here.
%One shall construct mock surveys with the above effects included for the correction of systematics.


%The outer boundary of the mock survey becomes fuzzy due to the peculiar velocity effect 
%on the galaxy redshifts (Eq. (\ref{eq:zvpeu})).
%A population of galaxies, that are expected to enter the $z<0.7$ region from the outside, is missing.
%(these $z>0.7$ galaxies have a peculiar velocity toward us and 
%their observed redshfits become lower than 0.7).
%To avoid this problem we set the maximal redshift at 0.693, 
%23.3 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ away from $z=0.7$.

\subsubsection{More discussion}

In summary, we aim to minimise the redshift evolution of the shape of the normalised angular 2pcf; 
the shape change is dramatic when considering a cosmology much deviated from the fiducial model.
However even in the case of the correct cosmology there remains a small signal, due to growth of structures, RSD and galaxy bias. 
These systematics are removed with the aid of simulations.
The procedure of the correction of systematics is similar to what was implemented in our previous papers \cite{Li2014,Li2015,Li2016}.

The systematics are estimated from a simulation conducted using a particular cosmology. 
There could be a bias in the estimation if the simulation cosmology is different from the truth. 
The bias would not be serious if the simulation cosmology turns out to be consistent with the best-fit cosmological parameters obtained from the analysis \cite{Li2016}. 
In the case that there is a large discrepancy between the simulation cosmology and the best-fit cosmology, one needs to adjust the simulation cosmology and re-do the analysis.

A more precise approach would involve estimating the systematic effect from a set of simulations covering the relevant volume of the parameter space. 
This would remove the remaining uncertainty associated with the cosmological dependence. 
This approach would also enable the estimation of the $systematics\ errors$, 
which could be important when the sample size is large enough and the $systematic\ error$ becomes as small as the $statistical\ error$.

The third row of Figure \ref{fig_sys} shows that, 
if having a large difference in bias between the samples,
there is a large systematic variation on small scales. 
This means that an accurate modelling of systematics from simulations is required. 
To avoid the possible difficulty, one can conduct the analysis using a volume-limited sample, 
where the redshift evolution of galaxy properties is small and the systematic effect from RSD and galaxy bias is also small,
as shown by the fourth row of Figure \ref{fig_sys}.

To avoid the large systematics in the nonlinear regime, 
another solution would be to increase the scale of analysis to larger separations where the non-linear effect is becoming subdominant. 
Figure \ref{fig_sys} shows that, 
on scales of $s=20-50 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$ the systematic effect is 2-3 times smaller than that of $s=5-20 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$. 
Actually, we tested and found that, using $s = 5-40 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$ and $20-40 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$, 
yields cosmological constraints that are pretty close to each other (see \S 4). 

We do not consider the systematic effects in case of non-standard cosmological scenarios such as modified gravity and warm dark energy. 
These topics go beyond the scope of this work, and they are worthy future investigations.



\subsection{Likelihood Analysis}


Adopting the correct cosmological model will resulting in minimal evolution of the normalised 2pCF.
Thus we proceed to construct a quantitative likelihood estimator that reflects this property.
The procedure here is very similar to \cite{Li2014,Li2015,Li2016}.
We compare the high redshift $\hat\omega_{r_\perp}$ and the lowest redshift measurement,
\begin{equation}
 \delta \hat{\omega_{r_\perp}}(z_i,z_1) \equiv \hat{\omega_{r_\perp}}(z_i) - \hat{\omega_{r_\perp}}(z_1),
\end{equation}
and design the likelihood function to quantify
the redshift evolution of $\hat\omega_{r_\perp}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chisq1}
\chi^2\equiv \sum_{i=2}^{n_{z}} \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_{r}} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_{r}} {\bf p}(z_i,r_{j_1}) ({\bf Cov}_{i}^{-1})_{j_1,j_2}  {\bf p}(z_i,r_{j_2}),
\end{equation}
where $n_z$ is the number of redshifts which is 5 in this analysis, 
$n_r$ is number of binning in $\hat{\omega}_{r_\perp}(r_\perp)$,
which is 35 since we have $r_\perp$ bins 
with width $1h^{-1}\rm Mpc$ in a range of $5h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}\leq r_\perp\leq 40h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$.
${\bf p}(z_i,r_{j})$ is the redshift evolution of the angular correlation function shape with systematic effects subtracted
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:bfp}
 {\bf p}(z_i,r_{j}) \equiv&\ \delta \hat{\omega_\perp}(z_i,z_1,r_j) - \delta \hat{\omega}_{r_\perp,\rm sys}(z_i,z_1,r_j)
\end{eqnarray}
${\bf Cov}_i$ is the covariance matrix estimated from the ${\bf p}(z_i,r_{j})$ measured from 120 subsamples.
%It is difficult to conduct the 2pCF of the whole snapshot box with hundreds of millions of galaxies.
%We split the box into 120 subsamples with $X,Y,Z$ sizes of $1575h^{-1}{\rm Mpc},1575h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}, 105h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
%and measure the angular 2pCF in the $X-Y$ plan in these subsamples. 
%The average of the 2pCFs are taken as the 2pCF of the whole box.
%The covariance matrix is also estimated from the redshift evolution of these subsamples.
As mentioned previously, for a robust estimation of the covariance matrix, 
we always compare slices at different locations to 
include the cosmic variance.

The covariance matrix inferred from a finite number of samples
is always a biased estimate of the true matrix \citep{Hartlap}.
This can be corrected by rescaling the inverse covariance matrix as 
\begin{equation}
 {\bf Cov}^{-1}_{ij,\rm Hartlap} = \frac{N_s - n_{r}-2}{N_s-1} {\bf Cov}^{-1}_{ij},
\end{equation}
where $N_s=120$ is the number of mocks used in covariance estimation.
For this analysis the rescaling is as large as 1.43.
In the case that one has 2\,000 mocks the rescaling is less than 1.02.


%estimated from the 72 sets of PSB mock galaxies identified from HR3 N-body simulation.


Figure \ref{fig_cosmo} displays the 2pCF and the likelihood values when adopting 
the four incorrect cosmologies used in Figure \ref{fig_xyquan}.
For the cosmologies $\Omega_m=0.4,w=-1$ and $\Omega_m=0.26,w=-0.5$,
the compression shifts the clustering patterns to smaller scales
at higher redshift and make the 2pCFs steeper.
%and also becomes more significant at higher redshift.
%We get 2pCFs with steeper slope and the higher redshift the steeper.
For the cosmologies $\Omega_m=0.15,w=-1$ and $\Omega_m=0.26,w=-1.5$,
the stretch of structure leads to a shallower slope of $\hat{\omega}_{r_\perp}$ at higher redshift.
%the shallower.
In all cosmologies there is significant detection of redshift evolution.
We compute the $\chi^2$ values according to Equation \ref{eq:chisq1}, 
and find that these cosmologies are disfavored 
at $\gtrsim30\sigma$ CL.






\section{Cosmological constraint}


We constrain $\Omega_m$ and $w$ through a Bayesian analysis (\cite{Bayesian}; also see \cite{LB2002,Li2016}).
We assume that the likelihood takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:like}
 \mathcal{L} \propto \exp\left[-\frac{\chi^2}{2}\right],
\end{equation}
and scan the parameter space in the $\Omega_m-w$ plane to obtain the 68.3\% and 95.4\% CL regions.
The result is displayed in the left panel Figure \ref{fig_contours}.


We obtain tight constraints on the two parameters.
The 2$\sigma$ contour lies within the region $0.23<\Omega_m<0.29$, $-1.1<w<-0.9$.
The two parameters are very strongly degenerated with each other,
and the area of constrained region is quite small.
The thin shape of the contour implies that, 
when combining with other observational data with a different direction of degeneracy (e.g. CMB, BAO),
a very tight combined constraint can be obtained.

In the case of fixing one parameter at its best-fit value and constraining the other,
one obtains very small 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $\delta\Omega_m\approx0.003,\delta w\approx0.01$.

In case that we do not have high redshift galaxies, the constraint becomes weaker.
The upper-right panel of Figure \ref{fig_contours} displays that, 
in case that we only use the galaxies at $z=$0, 0.5 and 1, 
the 2$\sigma$ uncertainties of $\delta\Omega_m\approx0.01,\\ \delta w\approx0.1$ (the other parameter fixed at its best-fit value).
The area of contour is further enlarged by $\approx 50\%$ if we only use galaxies at $z=$0 and 0.5.


So far we simply follow the convention of \cite{Li2016} and adopts $5\hMpc <s< 40\hMpc$. 
As discussed in the \S 4.3.3, one may want to avoid large systematics in the non-linear regime. 
In this case one can adopt $20\hMpc<s<40\hMpc$,
which significantly reduces the systematic effects while not much weaken the power of the final constraints,
as shown by the lower-left panel of Figure \ref{fig_contours}.

The choice of the redshift width $105 \hMpc$ is also slightly little arbitrary. 
It should be larger than the distance distortion from the RSD and redshift errors.
The optimistic scheme of clustering scales and redshift width should depend on the specific galaxy sample used in the analysis. 
One could adjust them to have a good balance between the power of cosmological constraint and the size of systematic effect.





\section{Concluding Remarks}
 
We have developed a method for constraining certain cosmological parameters by measuring the redshift evolution of the shape of the galaxy angular correlation function, $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}$.
We found that a wrongly adopted cosmology results in a redshift-dependent mis-scaling in the constructed galaxy distribution,
which in turn leads to a redshift-dependent rescaling of $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}(r_\perp)$.
The redshift dependent effect is sensitive to cosmology while being relatively insensitive to the gravitational growth of structure,
the galaxy bias, and the RSD effect.
We tested our method on the HR4 mock galaxies having 457, 406, 352, 306 and 228 million galaxies at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.
Analyzing the redshift evolution of $\hat \omega_{r_\perp}(r_\perp)$ 
on scales $5  h^{-1} {\rm Mpc} \leq r_\perp \leq 40 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$, 
we derive tight constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $w$.

 
In this analysis we restrict our focus to the rescaling in the angular direction.
%The angular correlation function is adopted as a statistical tool to probing the scaling effect in the angular direction.
One can also use the 2D 2pCF $\xi(s,\mu)$ 
as a function of both angular and radial scale to fully probe the scaling effect in the 3D galaxy distribution.

There are already works using the angular 2pCF to constrain cosmology
by directly comparing the theoretical 2pCF and the observed one \citep{Salvador2014,Salvador2016}.
Our method is simpler and just uses the fact that in the correct cosmology the angular 2pCF shape
does not exhibit significant redshift evolution.
%is insensitive to redshift in correct cosmology.
Our method is complementary to these works in that
it does not require accurate analytic modeling, 
and could be applicable on smaller scales.
%The two different approaches can be combined together to fully extract the cosmological information.

 

\cite{Li2015,Li2016} shows that using the redshift dependence of the AP effect, 
one can derive very tight cosmological constraints.
The method presented in this paper studies the redshift evolution of the volume effect.
%We hope this method also.
These two methods probe different information encoded in the 2pCF 
and can be combined to give a complete geometric probe of the LSS galaxy distribution.
%Or one can also use the redshift evolution of 2D 2pCF xi(s,mu) to have all information included.

This method is designed to be applied to current and future LSS surveys,
with a particular emphasis on {\it photometric surveys}.
The galaxy angular 2pCF in redshift shells is much less affected by the large redshift errors compared wit the 3D 2pCF.
DES will probe hundreds of millions of galaxies at $z\lesssim1.5$, 
and LSST will probe tens of billions of galaxies at $z\lesssim2$.
We expect very tight cosmological constraints from these surveys.
%and the redshift error will not quite affect the angular 2pCF measurement 
%as long as the redshift dependence of the photometric redshift can be reliably understood.


Our series of works \cite{Li2014,Li2015,Li2016}, together with this analysis, 
and also \cite{topology,MS2016},
are introducing a new strategy to constrain cosmology from galaxy clustering.
We utilize a statistical pattern which remains constant at all redshifts;
this invariance is broken when incorrect cosmologies are adopted to construct the galaxy distribution
and introduces redshift evolution of geometric distortion.
The systematic effects can be corrected by performing a N-body simulation 
in a cosmology with values of parameters close enough to the underlying correct one.
This avoids the difficulty in the analytical modeling the galaxy clustering, galaxy bias and RSD,
and enables reliable cosmological constraint on relatively small clustering scales.
We hope these methods play an important role in deriving cosmological constraints from future LSS surveys.
